Customers can see what’s new in the store and can scan bar codes with the phone’s camera for prices and lists of everything in a shopper’s cart so they know their total before getting to the checkout.</p><p>Wired.com points out that Walmart has effectively lured customer into two stores at once as the Walmart app interface lets you “flip” between the two stores–physical and digital.</p><br/><a href="http://www.canadiangrocer.com/top-stories/walmart-embraces-showrooming-18540">See on canadiangrocer.com</a>
